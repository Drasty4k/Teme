        <p>The only exception is if your paste destination has a font which doesn't support some unicode characters.
            For example, you'll might find that some websites don't use a unicode font, or if they do, the font doesn't have
            all the characters required. In that case, you'll see a generic "box" in which was created when the browser tries
            to create a fancy letter. This doesn't mean there's an error with this translator, it just means the website's font
            doesn't support that character.The only exception is if your paste destination has a font which doesn't support some unicode characters.

            <p>ASCII characters are the first 128 symbols of Unicode, and these are the things that you're reading right now.
                But there are far more than 128 symbols in Unicode, and it just so happens that there are quite a few that look a 
                bit like the normal Latin alphabet (i.e. that look like English text). We can take advantage of that to make
                "pseudo-alphabets" which resemble normal ASCII text, but which have certain differences - such as being bolder,
                 or italic, or even upside down! These "alphabets" often aren't perfect - they're basically "Unicode hacks" which 
                 take advantage of various symbols from different sets all throughout the 100k+ symbols in the standard..</p>

                <p>The term "font" actually refers to a set of graphics that correspond to some or all of the Unicode glyphs.
                    You've probably heard of "Comic Sans" and "Arial" - these are fonts. What you're copying and pasting above are 
                    actually symbols that exist in every font. So the cursive text and other fancy letters that you're seeing above 
                    are actually separate character, just like "a" and "b" are separate characters... So that's how we ended up with 
                    such a large and strange/fun array of symbols, and that's the reason you're here! I've put together a bunch of 
                    fonts for Instagram that should be fun to play with and use for your bio. You may want to mix and match certain 
                    parts from different font styles.</p>
